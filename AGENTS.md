# Connect Server Overview

This repository hosts the code for **Knolia Connect**, a small API server that matches users for relationships using AI embeddings. The server is built with FastMCP and FastAPI, stores data in Supabase, and relies on OpenAI for embeddings.

## Purpose
- Provide endpoints to create, update, or delete a user's connection profile.
- Embed profile data as a 1536â€‘dimension vector using OpenAI.
- Store profiles in Supabase (`user_connect_profiles` table).
- Find compatible matches by comparing vector similarity.

## Data
A connection profile contains:
- Name and age
- Relationship goals and short bio
- Personality tags
- Sexual preferences
- Location

Before saving to Supabase, the profile is serialized to text and embedded with OpenAI. Environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are loaded from a `.env` file.
